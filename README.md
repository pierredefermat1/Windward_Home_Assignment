# Windward_Home_Assignment
In this assignment I was asked to investigate meetings between tanker vessels in the Black Sea, occured in the past year using WindWard's 2 different datasets:

current_benefitial_owners - a dataset contains info about the owners of tanker vessels that were involved in those meetings.
tanker_meetings_black_sea_last_year - a dataset contains info about the meetings, and vessels involved.
In this project I used Pandas library for analyzing the given info.
